# TVC Director

[中文版](README.md)

From product brief to cinematic TVC keyframes — your AI advertising creative director.

A skill that turns your AI agent into a **TVC Advertising Creative Director**, handling the complete creative pipeline for television commercials and brand advertising: from a product brief to production-ready **Nano Banana Pro** keyframe prompts and **Seedance** Multi-Phase video scripts.

## Two Core Capabilities

### 1. Cinematic Product Breakdown

Not just 360° rotation — multi-phase product micro-films with:

- Component disassembly/assembly animations (floating parts, exploded views, snap-back)
- Feature visualization (screen lighting up, tracking boxes, digits ticking 00:00:00→04:00:00, sensor glow)
- Material macro shots (brushed metal, glass refraction, carbon fiber weave)
- Precise per-second camera choreography (ultra-slow reveal → explosive rotation → macro dive)
- Cinematic studio lighting (low-key, side light silhouettes, light flowing with rotation)

### 2. Brand World Crosscut

Products don't live on black backgrounds — they live in their brand world:

- Outdoor cameras → skydiving, diving, skiing, climbing
- Luxury watches → racing, sailing, formal events
- Skincare → morning rituals, natural springs, sunrise
- Sportswear → urban parkour, marathon, rain-soaked streets

TVC crosscuts between "product close-ups" and "brand world usage scenes", connected via match cuts (skier spinning → product spinning).
